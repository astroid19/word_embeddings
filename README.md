# Word Embeddings

This project demonstrates how to use word embeddings using Gensim's pre-trained models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Gensim library

### Pre-trained models

* The script uses the `word2vec-google-news-300` model. Other models can also be used by changing the `api.load()` method.
